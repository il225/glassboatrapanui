# HOW DID WE GET HERE?

A few things happened...  
1. I downloaded Local for WordPress development on my machine
2. I created the Glass Boat Rapa Nui Website on WordPress
   - this step included lots of research and patience
   - required making WordPress account
   - also made Local account to make live link (W feature)
3. I downloaded and used Static to make the page deployable
   - this fixed the mistake I made with trying to upload all of the wordpress site
4. I used Cloudflare Pages to deploy and host the site
